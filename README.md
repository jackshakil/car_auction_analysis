This paper presents a comparative study on car auction analysis, aiming to predict whether a car is a GoodBuy or a BadBuy using a dataset with extensive attributes. The study addresses limitations in the traditional approach by employing advanced feature selection techniques such as feature importance ranking, scaling, and interaction. The authors explore three feature selection methods and compare three classification algorithms. Results highlight that K-means clustering-based feature selection achieves the best f1 score, while Random Forest and AdaBoost perform well among the classification algorithms. Proper feature selection and normalization are identified as crucial for high accuracy in the model. This study demonstrates the significant improvements achieved through feature selection and the selection of appropriate classification algorithms in car auction analysis.
